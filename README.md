Welcome to my **interactive, code-first learning journey** through
💡 *“An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in Python (ISLP)”*
by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani & Jonathan Taylor.

This repository is designed to be:

* 🌱 A **learning diary**
* 🧭 A **study roadmap**
* 📘 A **concept reference**
* 🧪 A **lab playground**
* 🚀 A **portfolio-ready ML showcase**

# 🎯 Learning Approach

My personal system for mastering ISLP:

### 🧠 **1. Read → Understand → Summarize**

Short, concept-driven notes
(Fewer words, more intuition.)

### 💻 **2. Reproduce → Re-Explain Labs**

Rewrite every plot and model in my own style.

### 🧮 **3. Solve End-of-Chapter Exercises**

Understanding comes from *doing*, not reading.

### 📈 **4. Build Mini-Projects After Each Chapter**

Example:

* Linear Regression → House Price Model
* Classification → Iris/Heart Disease Classifier
* Trees → Loan Default Predictor
* Unsupervised → Customer Segmentation

### 🧩 **5. Build a Final Capstone**

A polished ML project using ISLP concepts.
