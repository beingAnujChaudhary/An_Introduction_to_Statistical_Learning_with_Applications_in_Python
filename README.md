This repository serves as my personal study companion for **"An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in Python"** (James, Witten, Hastie, Tibshirani, Taylor). 

It contains my:
- 📝 **Chapter Summaries & Key Concepts**
- 💻 **Lab Implementations** (reproduced and annotated)
- 🧠 **Solutions to Applied Exercises**
